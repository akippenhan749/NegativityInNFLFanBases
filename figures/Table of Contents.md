| Figure Name | Variables | Summary |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boxplot Compound by Region | x = `Region`, y = `Compound` | There is not clear differences in distributions between Regions for Compound score. The medians for all appear to be the same, with the West being the most condensed. |
| Boxplot Compound by Team | x = `Team`, y = `Compound` | There are clear differences in distributions between Teams for Compound score. The New England Patriots have the lowest distribution and the Dallas Cowboys have the most condensed distribution around the median. |
| Boxplot Negative by Team | x = `Team`, y = `Compound` | There are clear differences in distributions between Teams for Negative score. Some teams have little to no negative ratings above 0, while others have a more visble distribution. All distributions have a median around 0. | 
| HistogramDensity Compound by Region | x = `Compound`, y = `Density`, colored density curves by `Region`| The density plot shows a roughly normal distribution for each Region, with a large density around the median. The West has the highest density around the median and the Midwest has the lowest. |
